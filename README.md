#Overview
A simple physics simulator and visualizer for creating visually appealing videos. This project is primarily used for programming practice, with milestones posted to the SerenePySim Tiktok channel.

##Disclamer
This project is being completed for fun, as college work permits. Additionally, some simulations are purposefully unstable and may cause unexpected behaviour on other machines. See the SerenePySim Tiktok channel for simulation results.
